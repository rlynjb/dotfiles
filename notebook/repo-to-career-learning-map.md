# Repo-to-Career Learning Map: Full-Stack, System Design, Cloud & AI Concepts

**What it does:** Reviews a repository as a learning exercise and maps the codebase to the full-stack, system design, cloud, distributed-systems, and AI concepts I am building toward.

Review this repository as a learning exercise for me as a full-stack software engineer.

My goal is to understand the system end-to-end and identify which software-engineering concepts I am already touching in this codebase, especially the concepts relevant to my career direction: frontend, backend, full-stack, APIs, databases, cloud, system design, distributed systems, data flow, orchestration, reliability, and AI systems if applicable.

Please analyze the repository and produce a structured learning guide with the following sections:

1. System Overview

Explain in plain English:
- What this application/system does
- Who or what uses it
- The major components
- The main technologies/frameworks/languages
- Whether the repository is primarily frontend, backend, full-stack, infrastructure, data, AI, or a combination

Give me a simple architecture diagram such as:

User → Frontend → API → Backend → Database → External Services

Expand it based on what actually exists in the repository.

2. Frontend

If frontend code exists, identify:
- Entry points
- Main framework
- Routing
- Components
- State management
- API/data fetching
- Authentication/authorization handling
- Error/loading handling
- Important frontend architectural patterns

For each item, point me to representative files/directories and explain what they do in beginner-friendly terms.

3. Backend

If backend code exists, identify:
- Application/server entry points
- APIs/endpoints
- Controllers/handlers
- Services/business logic
- Database access
- Authentication/authorization
- Background jobs/workers
- Queues/events
- Caching
- External service integrations
- Logging/monitoring/error handling

Show me a typical request flow through the codebase from incoming request to response.

Example:

Frontend → API route → controller → service → repository/database → response

Use the actual files/functions/classes from this repository.

4. Data Layer

Explain:
- Which databases/storage systems are used
- Schemas/models/entities
- ORM/query libraries
- Reads and writes
- Transactions, if any
- Indexing, caching, replication, sharding, or other data-system concepts if visible

Do not assume these concepts exist. Clearly distinguish between:
- Present in the repository
- Likely handled by infrastructure/external services
- Not visible/not used

5. Cloud / Infrastructure

Look for things such as:
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- CI/CD
- Terraform or infrastructure-as-code
- Serverless deployment
- Cloud provider configuration
- Load balancing
- Autoscaling
- Queues/pub-sub
- Object storage
- Secrets/configuration
- Observability

Explain which of these concepts I am actually touching and where.

6. Distributed-System Concepts

Check whether this system demonstrates any of the following:
- Service-to-service communication
- Multiple independently deployed services
- Queues/messages/events
- Retries
- Timeouts
- Idempotency
- Eventual consistency
- Replication
- Partitioning/sharding
- Transactions
- Concurrency
- Fault tolerance/failover
- Caching

For each concept, label it:

DIRECTLY PRESENT

INDIRECTLY PRESENT / MANAGED BY PLATFORM

NOT FOUND

Then explain why and point to evidence in the repository.

7. System Design Concepts I Am Touching

Create a table with:

| Concept | Present? | Where in the codebase | What it means | How deeply I am touching it |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Include at least:
- Client/server
- HTTP/APIs
- SQL/NoSQL
- Caching
- Load balancing
- Stateless services
- Horizontal scaling
- Queues/workers
- Pub/Sub/events
- Replication
- Sharding/partitioning
- Transactions
- Reliability
- Retry/idempotency
- Consistency
- Distributed systems
- Cloud
- Containers/serverless

Use these depth labels:

AWARENESS — used indirectly, little implementation exposure
WORKING WITH — I regularly interact with it in application code
IMPLEMENTING — I am directly building/configuring it
ARCHITECTING — I am making design/tradeoff decisions around it

8. AI / Agentic Concepts

Only if AI-related code exists, identify:
- Model/API calls
- Prompting
- RAG/retrieval
- Embeddings/vector search
- Tools/function calling
- Agents
- Orchestration
- State/memory
- MCP
- Evaluation
- Guardrails
- Model routing
- AI observability

Again, point to actual code and do not infer features that are not present.

9. Map the Repository to My Career Vocabulary

For each term below, tell me whether this repository gives me practical exposure to it:
- Frontend engineering
- Full-stack engineering
- Backend engineering
- Cloud
- Data systems
- System design
- Distributed systems
- Orchestration
- Production systems
- AI systems
- AI product engineering

For each, explain:
- What evidence supports it
- Which files/components I should study
- Whether my exposure is beginner, intermediate, or advanced

10. Map to My Books

Connect things you find in the repository to concepts from:
- A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms
- System Design Interview — Alex Xu
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications, 2nd Edition

For DDIA 2e specifically, map relevant code/system behavior to:
- Ch. 1 — Trade-Offs in Data Systems Architecture
- Ch. 2 — Defining Nonfunctional Requirements
- Ch. 4 — Storage and Retrieval
- Ch. 5 — Encoding and Evolution
- Ch. 6 — Replication
- Ch. 7 — Sharding
- Ch. 8 — Transactions
- Ch. 9 — The Trouble with Distributed Systems
- Ch. 10 — Consistency and Consensus
- Ch. 12 — Stream Processing

Only map chapters where there is a real connection.

11. Trace 3 Real Flows

Choose three meaningful workflows from this repository and trace them end-to-end.

For each flow, show:

Trigger → Frontend → API → Backend → Data/External System → Result

Include filenames, functions/classes, and important data transformations.

Prefer flows that teach me different parts of the stack.

12. What I Should Study Next

Based only on this repository, identify:
- Concepts I already work with but probably need to understand more deeply
- Important system components I have not yet explored
- Concepts that are useful for this system but absent from my current knowledge

Rank them:

HIGH PRIORITY
MEDIUM PRIORITY
LATER

13. Hands-On Learning Tasks

Give me 5–10 concrete exercises I can do inside this repository without making unnecessary production changes.

Examples:
- Trace one API request end-to-end
- Add logging around a request path
- Find one database query and explain its performance characteristics
- Diagram one workflow
- Identify a retry/failure scenario
- Explain how authentication flows through the stack
- Find where configuration/secrets enter the application

Make the exercises specific to this repository.

Important rules:
- Do not guess.
- Cite actual file paths, functions, classes, configs, and code when making claims.
- Clearly say when something cannot be determined from the repository.
- Explain concepts in plain English before using advanced terminology.
- Treat this as a learning guide, not just a code review.
- Focus on helping me understand why the system is designed this way, not only what each file does.
- When you find an architectural choice, explain at least one tradeoff or alternative.
- Prioritize understanding of the code I am most likely to encounter as a full-stack engineer.
